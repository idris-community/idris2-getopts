# idris2-getopts: Processing command line options in Idris2

This is a port of the corresponding module in the
[contrib](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/tree/main/libs/contrib) package of the
main Idris2 project, but the module has been moved to `System.GetOpts`
in order not to be in conflict with the one from contrib.
